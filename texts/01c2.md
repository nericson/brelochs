## Practica Teutsch for the year of our Lord 

Jesus Christ, our savior, fifteen hundred and twenty-nine, drawn from the teachings of wise astrologers, for the particular benefit of mankind, and compiled by Anthonium Brelochs, Doctor of Natural Science and Medicine in Schwäbisch Hall, appointed doctor, succinctly presented.

## To the steadfast, honorable, prudent, respected, and wise mayor and council of the city of Schwäbisch Hall, my gracious commanding dear sirs.

Esteemed, honorable, prudent, and wise sirs, my entirely willing and diligent service to you, gracious commanding dear sirs, has previously been at your disposal. The German practices of astronomy have hitherto faced much criticism among people of all ranks and have often been regarded as mere books of lies in many ways. Now, it is no less the case that if the art of astronomy, and its practices, sought to extend themselves so far as to infringe upon the Almighty Lord and God's power, wisdom, and foresight, and to encompass God's almighty power within their rules, statutes, and ordinances, then indeed it would be no wonder that such fierce criticism has been leveled against these practices by every honorable and devout Christian. But whoever desires to follow the truth rather than dismiss an art with which they are inexperienced and unfamiliar, without doubt would consider well that no honorable mind and heart would joyfully rise up against our Almighty Creator and seek to overpower God's eternal foresight with astronomy or any other art and wisdom. For, according to the teachings of the holy apostle Paul, we are well aware that God's almighty power cannot be circumscribed, that His judgments are unsearchable, His ways unfathomable, no one has been His counselor, but from Him, through Him, and to Him are all things. Also, we know that all things we wish to accomplish and do, in word and deed, should begin and end not in the name of the movement of the heavens, nor from the wisdom of the art of astronomy, but in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, who alone has been set and appointed by God, His heavenly Father, as the treasure of all divine knowledge. However, since our Almighty Lord and God first created the heavens and the sun and moon and other stars by His word and power, and will move and revolve them powerfully until the end of the world, and since He has ordained that the sun and the earth's vegetation respond to one another in such a way that anyone endowed with common human understanding daily observes how all vegetation on earth blooms joyfully in the sunlight and dies back and decays in winter's withdrawal of the sun, what should prevent us from recognizing that other similar natural occurrences on earth, namely, rain, heat, warmth, fertility, poor crops, peace, and war, are also indicated and observed from the natural order of the planets created by God? Therefore, divine power suffers no detriment, as He remains a ruler and protector of those who place their hope and trust in Him alone. He can, without the movement of the heavens, empower those who humble themselves before Him and humble those who exalt themselves against Him. Thus, divine or earthly power loses nothing by the true art of astronomy but rather is greatly enhanced. For the true divine astronomy is nothing other than a rule and measure of divine earthly action, which the Almighty God established and ordained through His creation of the heavens and the stars, not that He confined Himself within this order, but that He works and acts through the highest to the lowest in this world according to His common order. Therefore, no one needs to fear the stars and their influence, as the prophet Jeremiah attests. The righteous will not be troubled by the stars, and it is fitting for them to fear only God as their Lord. But the wicked always protect themselves, whether the stars are favorable or unfavorable. Even if the stars promise them great fortune in this world, what use is it if they use such fortune for their misfortune due to their wickedness? Thus, divine power suffers no loss, but rather divine order is clarified. Therefore, based on the teachings and counsel of the experienced in this art, I have wanted to reveal and publish the inclinations and influences of the stars, signs, and planets of this coming year, not arbitrarily but as a warning, and to present them in print for your special benefit, esteemed sirs. I will always remain dutifully and obediently subject to you, my gracious commanding sirs. Given on the day of John the Baptist, the 24th of June, 1528.

Humbly yours, appointed doctor,
Anthonius Brelochs, Doctor.

## Of the Eclipse of the Moon.

The moon will be eclipsed on Sunday after Gallus, the 17th day of October, in the third degree of Taurus, in the sign of its exaltation, starting at around 7 o'clock, the middle at 8 o'clock and 27 minutes, and ending at 10 o'clock and 4 minutes before noon, visible in the west at sunset, and it portends much evil and trouble. God willing, it will turn out for the best.

## The Planets' Dominion assigned and regarded as rulers of this 29th year of the lesser cycle.

For the sake of brevity, omitting the common causes of the heavens, such as the lord of the great cycle, which encompasses three hundred and sixty years, the portion, the perfection of the great conjunction, which sufficiently explains and reveals all significance of this my prognostication, I turn my attention to the planet that, in this coming year, above all others, will hold dominion. Considering the strength, power, and all the influence of all the planets in the twelve signs, especially when the sun enters the beginnings of the four cardinal signs, namely Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn, along with the celestial conditions of the preceding new and full moons, I proclaim according to the teachings of Ptolemy, Haly, and other ancient experts of this art, that the gentle and graceful Venus, being found in both figures of prevention and revolution, in the best circles and highest dignities, will be the ruler of this coming year, to whom the fierce and bloodthirsty Mars, a part of the great circle, will stand very close in his exaltation. Therefore, this year will be ruled by the fickle Venus, with her co-ruler the dreadful Mars, to whom Mercury and the envious Saturn will also lend their assistance. Thus, according to the course and nature of these planets (following the opinion of Leopold of Austria), the likelihood of all sorrowful events in our lower world will be recognized in this coming year. What can be expected from the above-mentioned influences will be noted plainly without particular embellishment.

## How the fruits of all growing things will be indicated in terms of abundance, scarcity, increase, and decrease this year.

According to the influence of the heavens and as much as can be observed from the principal constellations, since the higher things grant their power to the lower ones of the Earth and are thereby enhanced in their growth, this year will be more inclined toward fertility rather than infertility in our horizon, or at least it will hold the middle ground between the two. However, in terms of specific types of fruits, I say that corn, wheat, barley, and oats will show themselves in relatively good growth. If corn and some other fruits experience some distress, it will likely be due to slow growth, which will then be refreshed and improved by a fertile, mild air that will follow and revitalize what has been somewhat neglected. Although the wine will have a relatively good growth, it will fluctuate in various parts of our region. Certain areas, particularly those toward the setting sun and midday, should be warned to protect their vineyards from damage due to great cold and moisture, frost, and turbulent rains with hailstones. To conclude this chapter briefly, I say that the majority of the stars indicate an inclination toward sufficient fertility in wine and all other kinds of fruits, provided they are not adversely affected by cold and frost in spring or by violent wind and rain in summer. However, God, the creator of the stars and all growth on Earth, directs these and other things according to His divine will.

## Of wars, disputes, conflicts, and adversities to be expected this year.

Although Venus has the nature and complexion of Jupiter, being greatly inclined toward goodness and peace, Mars, the treacherous star, with its unmerciful, cruel, turbulent evils and enmities, will co-rule the great cycle this coming year, being positioned in the sign of its exaltation along with Saturn and Mercury, all in the corners of the celestial figures. In many lands and provinces, particularly towards the west, midday, and midnight, there will be strong tendencies towards conflict and strife, unheard-of troubles, much injustice, anger, fire, bloodshed, murder, destruction of homes, and other martial adversities and injustices driven by their influences. There will be appearances of military preparations, which will be difficult to dispel, although in some places they will lead more to peace and unity than to the ruin of the land. Although the beginning of the year and the start of summer will be marked by disruption, great discord, and conflict, it will be advisable for Germany to be well-prepared, as significant threats and dangers are indicated. There is also considerable concern that this year might not end without significant discord and war among the powerful and mighty. Moreover, envy and hatred will be felt by many. Haly Abenrabel states that when Mars is found in the third house of the revolution, it indicates that people will not readily unite, and envy, hatred, enmity, and opposition will arise among the populace. The great and mighty kings, princes, and all authorities should be cautious not to give too much freedom to their subjects. Mars, the bloodthirsty one, being found in a descending house of the revolution, reveals a tendency among the common people to revolt against their authorities. It is expected that wars, discord, and martial unrest will arise this coming year, extending for a time with some stability, as Mars indicates, being found in his house. Therefore, we should fervently call upon and pray to God, who created the heavens and the stars, that He may turn all things according to His divine will for the salvation of our souls.

## Of the diseases that will be somewhat more dangerous for people and animals this year due to the influence of the stars.

Through diligent consideration of the celestial figures of the planets and other fixed stars at the time of the sun's entry into the first points of Aries and the other cardinal signs, it is indicated that this coming year, people will be more inclined to receive harmful and deadly diseases. As the moon separates from the sun and inclines towards the angry planet Mars in prevention, Mars, as previously mentioned, holds power and exaltation this year along with Venus as co-ruler. According to the teachings of Ptolemy and Albumasar, this indicates rapid and severe fevers, bloody red swellings, and other diseases arising from heated and corrupted blood. Many people, especially towards the south and north and towards the setting sun, will face the danger of death due to bloody red flux of the bowels. Saturn, found in Taurus, also indicates various misfortunes and diseases in many parts of the world due to natural causes, contamination, disturbances, and unnatural changes in the air. The plague is particularly to be feared this year and will be found highly dangerous for the inhabitants of this seventh climate. Albumasar openly attests that when Saturn completes his course in Taurus, it indicates illnesses of the upper limbs and common ailments this year, such as headaches, nasal discharge, eye and ear pain, throat abscesses, chest diseases, coughs, stomach pains, liver obstructions, urinary retention, dropsy, gout, and intestinal inflammation. Both genders should be warned about swellings and pains in the private and shameful parts. There will also be significant severe diseases threatening livestock due to the influence of the stars. We should fervently pray to God, our creator and healer, that He may grant us grace to abstain from the various illnesses with which He punishes us and to improve our lives for the salvation of our souls.

## Of the conditions of people according to the nature and order of the seven planets, briefly described.

All people who are subject to the planet Saturn and follow its dominion, such as the elderly, monks, rough craftsmen, masons, and those who have a fervent love for agriculture, as well as those who have a melancholic nature, will live in dangerous and deadly conditions. They will face adversities from their authorities, their dealings will often be unsuccessful, and they will suffer great deceptions, leading to losses in trade, counsel, substance, and bodily nourishment. The monks will be persecuted, miners will suffer damage in the earth's mines, and farmers will be troubled by poor harvests in many places. All people under Saturn’s influence should take care of their bodies to prevent harmful humors from developing and causing severe diseases, which could quickly take many lives. They will be particularly at risk of the plague and should be cautious of headaches, chest pains, stomach ailments, gout, bloody fevers, dysentery, dropsy, and paralysis of the hands and feet. The troublesome periods for them will be March, May, and the beginning of autumn until the end of this year.

Those who are obedient to the planet Jupiter in their manners and practices, such as the clergy in general with their leaders, as well as older sanguine people, will experience little joy and prosperity. They will face many dangers due to envy, hatred, and anger from the common people. Many will engage in various conflicts with their subordinates and among themselves, often complaining about each other without much reason, driven by envy and hatred mixed with deceit, leading to significant distress, worry, and severe discontent from which they will struggle to free themselves. They will also be tightly bound by the chains of trouble since martial and contentious people will strive to oppose them. They will be threatened with food shortages and should beware of gout, painful swellings from excess blood, hip and foot pains, and are at risk of fever and the plague. They should protect themselves from the beginning of the year until the end of March, also in May and December, as these periods will be particularly troublesome, while the rest of the year will still require caution.

Those subject to the planet Mars and following its dominion, such as counts, barons, knights, soldiers, and all who work with metals and fire, as well as choleric people who are naturally hot-tempered, will experience considerable good fortune in their enterprises and receive recognition and honor in many areas. However, they should be warned in summer and thereafter not to encounter bad luck, adversities, and betrayals, and not to engage in quarrels and conflicts with one another. Knights and soldiers (according to Albumasar) will seek conflict with their enemies, risking their lives, with some fleeing from one place to another. They will face dangerous and virulent swellings, fevers, and illnesses that will take many lives. They are warned of bloody dysentery and hemorrhages. Their most dangerous periods will be January, June, until the end of August, October, and December, during which they should refrain from military engagements even if they expect to achieve victory.

Powerful kings, princes, and lords of high authority and noble lineage, along with their governors and stewards, who rule with great wisdom, discipline, honor, and friendly will, along with the virtuous nobility, all under the influence of the Sun, will experience internal conflicts and disobedience despite their friendly relations, driven by envy and hatred, resulting in notable disloyalty. Some will be very greedy for food and goods, burdening their people. They should be warned not to incite their subjects to rebellion and opposition. Some will foresee potential humiliation, as the stars indicate serious events, including deadly illnesses, with January, May, August, and winter being particularly unfavorable for them.

Those subject to the playful planet Venus in their manners and practices, such as women, maidens, musicians, all joyful and frivolous people, as well as lovers of fleshly indulgence, will experience some good fortune and joyful pleasure this year, leading many to fall into pride and haughtiness, becoming intolerable to one another. However, some will face death when Mars inflames and excites them to excessive lust, leading to deadly illnesses. By abstaining from gluttony, idleness, and heated encounters, they can avoid these influences. They will face diseases of the throat, swelling of the groin, stomach pain, liver obstructions from cold, and severe fevers. The plague will also be a danger. Their troublesome days will be the 13th of January, the 18th of June, from July to the end of August, the 30th of September, and the 15th of December. If they pass these times without serious illness or adversity, they will otherwise enjoy a fortunate year in which many will give birth.

People under the influence of the planet Mercury, such as merchants, scribes, accountants, astronomers, doctors, printers, poets, and all who engage in subtle arts and trades, will not have particularly good luck. As Albumasar attests, when Mars aspects Mercury unfavorably, those mentioned will have little success in their endeavors and business. They will be despised and oppressed by the authorities. Merchants will suffer great losses on water due to storms and bad weather and should beware of being robbed on their journeys. Likewise, officials, councilors of princes, city councilors, and those managing their accounts should act wisely to avoid misfortune from their lords and communities. Their troublesome periods will be from the beginning of the year until the end of February, March, April to the end of May, July, August to mid-September, November, and December. The stars indicate fevers, deadly illnesses of the head, eye diseases, throat ailments, gout, kidney stones, and gout for them.

People under the Moon's influence in their activities and nourishment, such as travelers, sailors, fishermen, bath attendants, and all common folk leading an unstable life and dealing with water, will find adversities this year. They will be hated by princes and lords, and will suffer much from their authorities. Some will gain little benefit from their goods and nourishment. They will also face threats from the military and receive injuries from them. Many will incite fires and conflicts among themselves, brother against brother, friend against friend, and companion betraying companion. Some will strive to rise against their rulers, raising concerns about civil and communal uprisings in many places. Therefore, rulers and councils should be vigilant against this evil. They will face headaches, eye ailments, joint pains with paralysis, and those living towards the sunrise and sunset will be warned of the plague. Their troublesome days are when the Moon moves from the 15th degree of Libra to the 15th degree of Scorpio, with bad aspects from the Sun, envious Saturn, and dreadful Mars.

## Of the conditions of various kingdoms, lands, and cities around the Earth.

Germany, Little Poland with the royal city of Krakow, Austria, Florence, Naples, Brunswick, France, Burgundy, and according to some opinions, Augsburg, should guard themselves against destruction by war and the breaking of homes. They will experience bloodshed in many places. The inhabitants will live in discord among themselves; some will suffer greatly with fears and troubles, endure imprisonment, and some lords and rulers of these lands will act harshly towards the people, greatly burdening them. Some will live tyrannically against their subjects, who should be warned not to revolt or meet a miserable end. Some lords will be greatly feared by the common people. Harsh cold, heavy rains, frosts, and occasional thunder and hail will threaten to damage the crops and vegetation of the earth, but these will mercifully pass, and they will have more than they hoped for. If the plague does not rule among them, they should give thanks to God.

The kingdoms of Spain and Hungary, the land of Moravia, and the Duchy of Milan, if not cautious, will feel intense war from the west and alarming uprisings in those regions caused by common dissent. Therefore, the lords and authorities of those lands should be vigilant and always guard against it. The stars threaten them with damage that may be inflicted by thunder, hail, lightning, and turbulent winds. If wine and grain are not adversely affected, they will have a bountiful harvest. They will experience poisonous swellings and the plague, and four-legged animals will suffer from severe ailments.

Italy, Bohemia, Austria, Sicily, Apulia, France towards Italy, Magdeburg, and other honorable cities in Lombardy will intensely focus on their enemies and past events, regretting their actions. Some princes, lords, and authorities of these places will attach themselves to people of good lineage from foreign lands and will attempt to seize power and authority from other princes and lords. Some powerful lords will act harshly towards the people, showing little compassion. The common people of these lands will be very inclined to engage in war and discord, leading to severe adversities. They will suffer various illnesses caused by winds and possibly by excessive blood.

Thuringia, Saxony, Hesse, Switzerland, Prussia, Russia, Bologna, Bamberg, and small regions in Asia will prepare for war, bringing them into distress and danger. Some will suffer great persecution from their authorities and internal discord, which may lead to bloodshed. They will face significant hindrances from neighboring lands, and their endeavors and plans will mostly be thwarted. Their authorities are warned that some may be taken by deadly diseases, which could lead to the destruction of the land. The crops and vegetation of the earth will be damaged in some places by excessive moisture and adverse weather. The plague will take many lives.

Swabia, Franconia, Alsace, Sunkau, Nuremberg, Augsburg, Salzburg, Ulm, Erfurt, Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Speyer, and surrounding cities, if not cautious this year, will experience discord in many places. Some will rise against their authorities, speak ill of them, and spread false and slanderous words. If they are not attacked by martial and some powerful princes and lords, they will otherwise have a fairly fortunate year. If any adversities arise, they will pass without significant harm. They will have relatively good growth of the earth's fruits in wine and grain. They will not be free from some illnesses, particularly headaches, hip, hand, and foot pains, and some will succumb to sudden illnesses and the plague. They should also guard against gout and all internal diseases.

## Of the weather conditions and changes in the air and storms during the four seasons of the year, with indications of the twelve months, their new, waning, and quarter moons, beginning with the state of winter.

Winter (which according to astrologers' calculations) begins on the 11th day of December at the 6th hour without any minutes past noon. According to the general influence of the stars, it will tend towards moderate cold, although in many places and cities towards the west, south, and north, sharp cold will rise for many days, causing damage to many things. In warm lands, moist weather with heavy snowfall will occur. It is to be expected that in this time, in some places, strong and violent winds comparable to whirlwinds will arise, being most dangerous to those living towards the south and west. Illnesses most concerning during this time will include headaches, strokes, chest diseases, coughs, side pains, throat abscesses, nasal discharge, gout, bowel disorders, bladder and kidney pain, and the plague, which will be most concerning to those living towards the south and north, although others will not feel entirely safe either. Four-legged animals used for human purposes will also suffer illnesses, and some will die.
