The following is text in German from a 1529 practica teutsch, or booklet of astrological prognostication. Please translate to English in a moderately idiomatic way. Do not translate any words within angle brackets <>, which are just locators for human readers, but do include those same terms, still in brackets, in the translation. Added: Do not use bullet points or charts or special formatting (except for line breaks between paragraphs or sections) and do not make the text more succicnt; simply translate the text as prose.
