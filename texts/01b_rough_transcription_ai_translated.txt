<sec02>
To the honorable, prudent, respectable, and wise Mayor and Council of the City of Schwäbisch Hall, my esteemed and beloved lords.

Esteemed and honorable gentlemen, in my earnest and diligent service to you, my beloved lords, it is known that German astrological practices have often been criticized and considered deceitful books by many. However, if the art of astronomy and its practices were perceived as challenging the Almighty Lord and God in His power, wisdom, and foresight, such criticism would indeed be justified. Yet, those who seek truth rather than dismissing an unknown and unfamiliar art would surely recognize that no honorable mind or heart would ever oppose our Almighty Creator. For we know, according to the teachings of the Holy Apostle Paul, that God's almighty power cannot be circumscribed, His judgments are incomprehensible, and His ways are unsearchable. No one has been His counselor, and from Him, through Him, and to Him are all things.

Although we should begin and end all our words and deeds in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the source of all divine wisdom, it is nonetheless true that our Almighty Lord and God, through His word and power, created the heavens, the sun, the moon, and the stars, and He moves them mightily until the end of the world. The sun, influencing the earth and its growth, causes all vegetation to flourish under its light and perish in winter. Similarly, natural phenomena such as rain, heat, fertility, and barrenness are governed by God's ordained planetary order. 

Despite this, divine power remains intact, and He continues to be the ruler and protector of those who place their trust in Him. He can empower those who humble themselves before Him and humble those who exalt themselves. Therefore, true astronomical science should lead us closer to the Almighty God, as it is a measure of divine order and effect, established by God through His creation of the heavens and stars.

Thus, from the teachings and counsel of experienced practitioners, I have determined the influence of the stars, signs, and planets for this upcoming year, not out of compulsion but for warning and publication. I present this to you, my esteemed lords, for your particular pleasure, and remain, as always, your humble, obedient servant.

Given on the day of John the Baptist, the 24th of June, in the year 1528.

Your obedient, appointed physician,
Anthonius Brelochs, Doctor.

On the Eclipse of the Moon.
¶ The Moon will be eclipsed on the Sunday after the Feast of Saint Gall, the 17th day of October, in the third degree of Taurus, in the sign of its exaltation. The eclipse will begin at approximately 7 o'clock, reach its peak at 8:27, and end at 10:04 before noon. This eclipse, which will be visible in the west as the sun sets, portends much trouble and adversity. May God turn it to good.

<sec04>
Which Planet is Assigned the Rulership and Regarded as the Ruler of the Year 1529.
¶ For brevity, I omit the general causes of the heavens, such as the lord of the great cycle, which spans three hundred and sixty years, the partial conjunction, and the great conjunction’s projection, all of which sufficiently explain and reveal my prognostication. I turn my attention to the planet that will have the predominant influence this coming year. Considering the strength, power, and authority of all the planets in the twelve signs, particularly when the Sun enters the beginning of the four cardinal signs—Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn—along with the positions of the preceding new and full moons, I proclaim, according to the teachings of Ptolemy in his second book of the Tetrabiblos, and Haly and other experienced practitioners of this art, that Venus, found in the most favorable circles and highest positions in both the prevention and revolution figures, will be the ruler of this coming year. 

However, Mars, the fierce and bloodthirsty planet, seen near its exaltation in the partial conjunction, will also have significant influence. Thus, this year will be ruled by the capricious Venus, alongside the fierce Mars, with Mercury and the envious Saturn contributing their influences. Consequently, according to the nature and course of these planets (following the opinion of Leopold of Austria), the events and circumstances of this upcoming year will be recognized as such: 

<sec05>
How the Crops of All Growing Things Will Indicate Prices, Scarcity, and Prosperity This Year.
¶ According to the influence of the heavens and as observed from the principal constellations, which bestow their power upon the Earth, this year will incline more towards fertility than barrenness in our horizon, or at least maintain a balance between the two. Regarding specific types of crops, I predict that grains, wheat, barley, and oats will show reasonable growth. Should some crops face challenges due to slow growth, a mild and fertile season will follow, reviving what was previously delayed. 

The vineyards, although expected to have a decent growth, will experience fluctuations. Certain regions, particularly those facing west and south, should beware of damage from severe cold, humidity, frost, and tumultuous rains with hail. Thus, summarizing this chapter, most celestial indications suggest a trend towards sufficient fertility in wine and other fruits, provided they are not hindered by cold and frost in spring or stormy winds and rains in summer. Nonetheless, God, the Creator of the stars and all earthly growth, will arrange these matters according to His divine will.

<sec06>
On Wars, Quarrels, Conflicts, and Adversities to Be Expected This Year.
¶ Although Venus, with her nature and temperament similar to Jupiter, inclines towards kindness and peace, Mars, the treacherous star, with his merciless, cruel, and tumultuous enmities and hostilities, will co-rule this year alongside the partial conjunction. Mars will be found in his exaltation sign, along with Saturn and Mercury, all positioned in critical celestial figures, causing significant unrest and conflicts in many lands and provinces, especially in the west, south, and north. This will bring forth unheard-of miseries, much injustice, anger, arson, bloodshed, murder, and destruction of homes, along with other martial adversities and injustices. 

Various armaments will be prepared, though some areas may see more peace and unity rather than devastation. However, at the beginning of the year and again at the onset of summer, turmoil, great discord, and unrest are expected. Thus, Germany should be cautious, as its future holds threats of significant strife. Additionally, it is not unlikely that this year will end without discord and war among the mighty and powerful. Many will also experience envy and hatred. Haly Abenrabel states that if Mars is found in the third house of the revolution, it signifies envy, hatred, discord, and hostilities among the people. 

Great and powerful kings, princes, and all authorities should ensure they do not give their subjects too much freedom. Mars, the bloodthirsty one, found in a cadent house of the revolution, indicates that the common people and subjects will be inclined towards war and rebellion against their authorities. This suggests that conflicts, discord, and martial unrest will extend for some time, as indicated by Mars' presence in his house. Therefore, we must fervently call upon and pray to God, who created the heavens and the stars, to turn all things towards the salvation of our souls according to His divine will.
<sec07>
On the Diseases that Will be More Dangerous to Humans and Animals this Year due to the Influence of the Stars.
¶ Through careful consideration of the established celestial figures, the planets, and other fixed stars at the time the Sun enters the first points of Aries and the other cardinal signs, it is indicated that in this upcoming year, people will be significantly predisposed to harmful and deadly diseases. As the Moon, after separating from the Sun in its prevention, inclines towards the angry planet Mars, which, as mentioned before, holds a significant influence this year along with Venus in its exaltation, it points to rapid and acute illnesses. According to the teachings of Ptolemy and Albumasar, this suggests sudden and quick death, sharp, feverish illnesses, and bloody, red swellings, as well as other diseases stemming from overheated and corrupted blood.

Many people, particularly in the south, north, and west, will be in grave danger of death due to bloody diarrhea and abdominal flux. Saturn found in Taurus indicates that, in many parts of the world, various severe diseases will arise from numerous natural causes, as well as pollution, disturbance, and unnatural changes in the air. Therefore, the plague is greatly feared this year and will be particularly dangerous to the inhabitants of the southern climate. Albumasar openly asserts that when Saturn completes its course in Taurus, it signifies illnesses in the upper limbs and general sicknesses in the community this year. These include headaches, nasal discharge, eye and ear infections, throat inflammations, frost-related illnesses, coughs, stomach pains, liver congestion, urinary retention, dropsy, gout, intestinal colic, and warnings of severe boils and pains in the private and shameful parts of both men and women. Additionally, the stars threaten notable epidemics affecting livestock up to the point of slaughter.

We must fervently pray to God, our Creator and Healer, to grant us His grace, so that we may abstain from the manifold diseases with which He punishes us and improve our lives for the salvation of our souls.
<sec08>
On the Conditions of People According to the Nature and Order of the Seven Planets, Briefly Described.
¶ All people who are subject to the planet Saturn and come under its influence, such as elderly people, monks, laborers, masons, and those who have a strong inclination towards agriculture, as well as those in whom the earthly nature known as melancholy predominates and who are cunning, will live in dangerous and deadly conditions. They will have to endure adversities from their authorities, and their affairs will often face setbacks, including great deceit. They will suffer losses in trade, in their advice, wealth, and bodily nourishment. Monks will be persecuted, miners will face harm in the mines, and farmers will be troubled in many places by poor crop growth. All those under Saturn’s power should protect their bodies from evil moisture that could lead to severe illnesses, resulting in quick deaths for many. The plague will be particularly dangerous for them, and they are also warned about headaches, chest pains, stomach issues, gout, severe fevers, diarrhea, dropsy, and paralysis of the hands and feet. Their most troublesome times will be March, May, and the beginning of autumn until the end of the year.

¶ Those who are obedient to the planet Jupiter with their customs and practices, such as the clergy with their rulers and those who are old and sanguine by nature, will experience little joy and prosperity. They will face many adversities from the common people due to envy, hatred, and anger. Many among them will engage in various disputes with their subordinates and among themselves without any significant cause, only out of envy and hatred mixed with falsehood, leading to notable distress, anxiety, and severe discontent. They will find it difficult to free themselves from these troubles. Additionally, many will be tightly bound by the ropes of distress when martial and contentious people attack them, threatening their nourishment. They should guard against gout, severe boils due to corrupted blood, hip and foot pain, severe fevers, and the plague. They should take special care from the beginning of the year until the end of March, in May, and in December, as these times will be particularly unfavorable.

¶ Those who are subject to the planet Mars and under its influence, such as counts, barons, knights, soldiers, and all those who work with water and fire, will find reasonably good fortune and advancement in many matters, gaining some fame and honor in their public actions. However, they are warned not to encounter misfortune and betrayal, with treacherous changes against each other during summer and afterwards. According to Albumasar's teachings, knights and soldiers will seek conflicts against their enemies this year, leading many to give up their lives, and some will flee from one place to another. They will be prone to severe, poisonous boils, hot fevers, and quick deaths. They should also be cautious of bloody flux and bloody diarrhea. Their most dangerous times will be January, July, August, October, and December, during which they should avoid war activities, even if they believe they will achieve victory.

¶ Great kings, princes, and lords of high power and noble birth, along with their governors and administrators, who govern with great wisdom, discipline, honor, and friendly intentions, will experience misfortune and disobedience among themselves, despite their usual friendliness. Envy and hatred will arise among them, along with considerable loyalty. Some will be very greedy for food and goods, burdening their people. These rulers should ensure they do not provoke their subjects into rebellion and discord. Some should be cautious of being humbled, as they face severe threats from the stars, with deadly diseases and unfavorable times in January, May, August, and the winter months.

¶ Those subject to the planet Venus with their customs and practices, such as women, maidens, musicians, and all joyous and frivolous people, as well as those inclined towards lust and unchastity, will experience some happiness and pleasure this year. However, many will fall into excessive pride and insolence against each other, though some will face death if Mars provokes and inflames them towards excessive unchastity, leading to deadly diseases. If they avoid gluttony, idleness, and revelry, this influence will not harm them. They are warned about throat pains, swollen necks, stomach pains, liver congestion from cold, sharp fevers, and the plague. Their unfavorable days are January 13, July 18, August, October 30, and December 15. If they pass these times without misfortune and serious illness, they will otherwise enjoy a fortunate year, with many friendly births.

¶ Those subject to the planet Mercury, such as merchants, writers, accountants, astronomers, doctors, book printers, and poets, as well as all those engaged in subtle arts and crafts, will not have much luck. According to Albumasar, when Mars views Mercury with a bad aspect, those mentioned above will have little success in their endeavors and trade, being despised and oppressed by authorities. Merchants will face significant losses on water due to storms and should be cautious of being robbed on their travels. Likewise, officials, advisors to princes, and city council members should be cautious with wisdom to avoid misfortune from their lords and communities. Their troublesome times will be from the beginning of the year until the end of February, in May, and in August to mid-autumn, and December, with hopes for little good fortune during these periods. They are also warned about plague fevers, deadly head diseases, eye, throat, gout, stone diseases, and gout.

¶ Those who have their activity and governance under the Moon, such as farmers, sailors, fishermen, bath attendants, and all common folk leading unstable lives and dealing with water, will find unfavorable fortune this year. They will be hated by princes and lords and will suffer much from their authorities. Some will gain little benefit from their goods and nourishment and will face considerable harm from soldiers. They will also experience many disputes and conflicts among themselves, with brothers turning against brothers, friends against friends, and companions betraying each other. Some will attempt to rise against their rulers and authorities, leading to civil unrest in many places. Therefore, the rulers and councils of cities should watch carefully to resist this evil. They will also suffer from head diseases, eye pains, limb pains with paralysis, and the plague. Their unfavorable days are whenever the Moon is in the 15th degree of Libra to the 15th degree of Scorpio, with bad aspects from the Sun, envious Saturn, and fierce Mars.
<sec09>
On the Conditions of Certain Kingdoms, Lands, and Cities around the World.
¶ Germany, Little Poland where the royal city of Krakow lies, Austria, Florence, Naples, Brunswick, France, Burgundy, and according to some opinions, Augsburg—these lands and cities should guard against destruction by war and the devastation of some homes. They will experience bloodshed in many places. The inhabitants will live in discord among themselves, some will suffer many anxieties and hardships, and some will endure imprisonment. Certain lords and rulers of these lands will mistreat the people, oppressing them greatly. Some among them will live tyrannically against their subjects, hence they are warned to avoid being overthrown or otherwise miserably perish. Also, certain lords of these places will be greatly feared by the common people. Sharp cold, heavy rains, frost, thunder, and hail will threaten the crops and growing things of the earth, though this will eventually dissipate, and they will have more than they expected. If the plague does not rule among them, they will give thanks to God.

¶ The kingdoms of Spain, Hungary, the land of Moravia, and the Duchy of Milan—if they are not cautious, they will feel intense war from the west and dreadful uprisings as the common people rebel in these places. Therefore, the lords and authorities of these lands should remain vigilant to prevent this. The stars threaten them with damage caused by thunder, hail, lightning, and violent winds. If the vineyards and crops are not harmed, they will have abundant growth. They will also experience severe poisonous boils, the plague, and the livestock will suffer greatly.

¶ Italy, Bohemia, Austria, Sicily, Apulia, France towards Italy, Magdeburg, and also other notable cities in Lombardy will be very focused on their enemies and past events, which they will regret having carried out. Some princes, lords, and authorities in these places will take in people of good lineage from foreign lands and will try to use them to take power and authority from other princes and lords. Also, some princes, lords, and powerful individuals in these places will act wickedly towards the people with little compassion. The common people of these lands will be very inclined towards war and discord, causing them to suffer cruel adversities. They will face various diseases caused by winds and sometimes by excessive blood.

¶ Thuringia, Saxony, Hesse, Switzerland, Prussia, Russia, Bologna, Bamberg, and small parts of Asia will prepare for war, leading them into distress and danger. Some will suffer great persecution from their authorities and will be very discordant among themselves, which could lead to bloodshed. They will face significant setbacks from neighboring lands and their undertakings will mostly be hindered. Their authorities are warned not to be taken by deadly diseases, which could lead to the destruction of their lands. The crops and growth of the earth will be damaged in some places by excessive moisture and unfavorable weather, and many will quickly die from the plague.

¶ Swabia, Franconia, Alsace, Sundgau, Nuremberg, Augsburg, Salzburg, Ulm, Erfurt, Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Speyer, and the surrounding cities—if they do not take care this year, many places will experience discord among them. Some will rise against their authorities, speaking evil and slanderous words against them. If they are not attacked by martial forces and certain powerful lords, they will otherwise have a fairly fortunate year. Any adversities will dissipate without significant harm. They will have reasonable growth of crops and wine. However, they will not be free from certain diseases, namely, they will suffer from head ailments, hip pains, hand and foot aches, and some will die from sudden illnesses and the plague. They should also guard against gout and all diseases of the intestines.
